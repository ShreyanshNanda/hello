// Question 30: Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. 
// Your function should return true if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false.

// Approach: Using DFS
Depth First Traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only 
if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestors in 
the tree produced by DFS. In the following graph, there are 3 back edges, marked with a cross sign. We can observe that these 3 back edges 
indicate 3 cycles present in the graph.

For a disconnected graph, Get the DFS forest as output. To detect cycle, check for a cycle in individual trees by checking back edges.
To detect a back edge, keep track of vertices currently in the recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. If a vertex is reached that is 
already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that connects the current vertex to the vertex in the recursion 
stack is a back edge. Use recStack[] array to keep track of vertices in the recursion stack.
T.C: O(V+E), Time Complexity of this method is same as time complexity of DFS traversal which is O(V+E).
S.C: O(V), To store the visited and recursion stack O(V) space is needed.
